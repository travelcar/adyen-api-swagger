  /Payment/v18/authorise:
    post:
      operationId: authorise
      summary: Creates a payment with a unique reference (pspReference) and attempts to obtain an authorisation hold, which can be "captured" or "cancelled" later. While for cards an authorised payment can be captured later, non-card methods typically don't support this and will automatically capture as part of the authorisation.

      summary: Captures a payment authorisation
      description: Captures the authorisation hold on a payment, returning a unique reference for this request. Usually the full authorisation amount is captured, however it's also possible to capture a smaller amount which results in cancelling the remaining authorisation balance. Payment methods which automatically capture as part of authorisation don't need to be captured, but submitting a capture request on these transactions will not result in double charges.
